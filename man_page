.SH DESCRIPTION

simple_shell is a command interpreter or command interpreter (CLI, Command-Line Interface) is the computer program that provides a user interface to access the services of the operating system and execute tasks described by the user.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SH COMPILATION

if the simple_shell still does not have an execution file, it is necessary to perform the compilation process from the .c files that host the source code, this process is recommended to do it with the GNU Compiler Collection and you must enter the following line:
.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o simple_shell
.P
.RE
after the compilation process, your simple_shell should work like this in interactive mode, typing the following line followed by an ENTER::
.P
.RS
.B $ ./simple_shell
.P
.RE
But also in non-interactive mode:
.P
.RS
.B $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./simple_shell
